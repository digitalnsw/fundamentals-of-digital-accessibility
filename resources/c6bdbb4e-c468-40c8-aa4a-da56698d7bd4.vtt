00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.000
An inclusive digital environment
means that everyone,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.480
regardless of their abilities

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.240
and needs, can fully engage,
participate and thrive.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.000
This includes people
with different needs and preferences

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.640
that may not be immediately apparent,
visible or situational or cultural.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.440
Imagine a parent navigating a website
one handed while cradling a baby.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.080
Or a person using voice commands
due to a temporary injury.

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.800
Consider the reliance on captions
when watching a training video

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
in a noisy environment,
or for those who are hard of hearing.

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.040
These examples show how important
digital accessibility is in

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.040
making sure
we can all participate online.

12
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.240
Together, we can build a more
inclusive digital environment where

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.800
nobody gets left behind.
