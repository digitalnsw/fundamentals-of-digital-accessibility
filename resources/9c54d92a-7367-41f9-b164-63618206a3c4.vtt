00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
The normality of being able to do tasks

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.000
that the average person does
is just such a huge thing.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.080
The separation between disability
and ability

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.280
is shrinking every day,
and that's massively huge.

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.760
And the development that's caused
that has literally changed our lives.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.240
There was

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.360
a little box online

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.320
where I had to talk to a robot.

9
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.720
I had to type to the robot
I can't type fast enough.

10
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.960
The robot, are you there?

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.280
Are you there?

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.200
And I'm like, Yes, I am.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.880
But I'm slow.

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.240
I went into my app, as I always do.

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.520
I got all the way through the process
and then right at the end

16
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.800
the transfer button was missing,
just plain out wasn't there.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.760
And they'd done an update overnight,
which I didn't know about,

18
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.880
and the update worked fine
for the majority of users,

19
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.280
but for people with blindness,
using the the app that I use,

20
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.720
they hadn't checked and I couldn't use it at all.

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.480
and that caused me so much anxiety
I still remember it today.

22
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.720
There was a time sensitive issue at work

23
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.440
that we needed to address
and I was needed in that meeting.

24
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.640
I was unable to join the call due to no
visual component and no caption component.

25
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.720
So therefore

26
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.040
I wasn't able to access it
and therefore I was removed from the job.

27
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.320
So I then had to call up a number

28
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.880
which wasn't really that helpful.

29
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.200
because I was on hold
for four hours

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.840
and then someone hung up on me.

31
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.160
I went on the website

32
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.120
to talk to

33
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.960
someone on the chat service.

34
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.080
They wanted people to ring up

35
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.640
to cancel a service.

36
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.480
I explained I had cerebral palsy

37
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.240
And eventually

38
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.840
I got an interpreter.

39
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.800
I wish I didn’t have to repeat

40
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.440
my same story

41
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.120
time and time again.

42
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.920
I do it because

43
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.960
it’s the only way I can

44
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.280
get to do everything

45
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.000
I wanna do.

46
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.320
Disability is the only minority that anyone
can become a part of at any given time.

47
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.920
The ability to express your access
needs easily in a digital way

48
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.280
is something that that I think
is inclusive across the board.

49
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.440
And I would absolutely love
to see more of that.

50
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.160
I always tell people that access
isn't hard if it's done at the start,

51
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.320
access is foundation and continuous.

52
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.480
It's like building a building.

53
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.680
You don't put the foundation in once
you've built the ten storey skyscraper.

54
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.200
So if you think about it at the start and
lay it down at the start, it'll be easy.
