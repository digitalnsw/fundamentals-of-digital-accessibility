00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
When I have full access to things
and all the assistive technology

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.720
is available at my fingertips and working,
it's a pretty wonderful thing.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.520
It feels like I'm on a level playing field
with everyone else around me.

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.560
QR, codes are so good.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.600
At an event with the QR code,

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.920
I can scan it straight away
where someone can ask a helper.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.920
I've got my own helper.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.160
Oh, I love QR codes.

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.080
When I'm a returning visitor to a website
and they’ve already stored

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.560
my information that I can just bring up

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.960
as soon as I type
the first letter of my name in.

12
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
I don't have to spend 5 minutes

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.480
filling out all of my information
when it’s already there.

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
I love my voice activating system.

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
It opens and closes my front door

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.120
turn on the TV, play a program on the TV.

17
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.480
I'm just so grateful
that there is such a thing.

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.360
Digital accessibility has

19
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.280
really transformed

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.360
my life.

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.120
And I’m able to work and

22
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.120
accomplish everything that I want to.

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.440
The normality of being able to do tasks

24
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.960
that the average person does
is just such a huge thing.

25
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.200
The separation between disability
and ability

26
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.400
is shrinking every day,
and that's massively huge.

27
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.880
And the development that's caused
that has literally changed our lives.
