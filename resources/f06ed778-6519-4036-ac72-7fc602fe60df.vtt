There was a, uh, time sensitive issue at work
that we needed to address

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.020 line:15 align:center
and I was, uh, needed in that meeting.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.520 line:15 align:center
I was unable to join the call due to 
no visual component and no caption component,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.520 line:15 align:center

and therefore I was removed from the job.
